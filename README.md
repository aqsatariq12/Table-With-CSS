# Table-With-CSS
This code creates a responsive HTML table that merges cells to organize seminar schedules. 
The table uses different background colors to distinguish between days and topics, and includes a header that spans multiple rows and columns. 
CSS styles are applied for visual enhancements, such as shadow effects and border styling.
